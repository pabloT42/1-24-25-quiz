#Write a function named PythagTheorem. It takes two integer parameters,
#a and b, and returns a number. When called, it treats the two numbers
#given as the shorter sides of a right triangle, and calculates the
#hypotenuse and returns it. Call the function in a print statement,
#and pass it 3 and 4 as arguments in the call (it should print 5).
